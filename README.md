CMatrix is a lightweight, cross-platform inference runtime designed specifically for executing neural networks on resource-constrained embedded systems and microcontrollers. Built with deterministic performance and minimal memory footprint in mind.
What CMatrix Is
CMatrix provides a lean inference engine for running pre-trained neural networks on embedded hardware where every kilobyte of RAM and microsecond of execution time matters. It focuses on inference only - no training capabilities.
Core Purpose:

Execute neural network inference on microcontrollers (ARM Cortex-M, RISC-V, etc.)
Provide deterministic, real-time performance characteristics
Minimize memory usage through static allocation and optimized operators
Enable AI capabilities in battery-powered, cost-sensitive devices

What CMatrix Is Not

Not a training framework - CMatrix only performs inference
Not a full ML platform - No data preprocessing pipelines or model management
Not for high-end hardware - Optimized for constraints, not maximum throughput
Not production-ready yet - Currently in early development (v0.1.0-alpha)

Key Features
Lean Architecture

Minimal footprint: Designed for systems with 32KB+ RAM
Static memory allocation: Predictable memory usage, no dynamic allocation
Modular operators: Include only the operators your model needs
Cross-platform: ARM Cortex-M, RISC-V, x86 (with platform-specific optimizations)

Performance Focus

Deterministic execution: Consistent inference times for real-time applications
Optimized operators: Hand-tuned implementations for common NN operations
Memory-efficient: Techniques like operator fusion and in-place operations
Quantization support: INT8 and INT16 quantized models (FP32 planned)

Current Status & Limitations
⚠️ Alpha Stage Warning
CMatrix is in early development. Expect:

Breaking API changes between versions
Limited operator support (see supported operators below)
Platform support varies (some targets experimental)
Documentation incomplete in many areas

Currently Supported

Operators: Conv2D, Dense/Linear, ReLU, MaxPool2D, Flatten
Platforms: ARM Cortex-M4/M7 (tested), x86 (development)
Model formats: Custom CMatrix format (conversion tools in development)
Data types: INT8, INT16

Not Yet Supported

Complex operators (LSTM, attention mechanisms, batch normalization)
Dynamic input shapes
ONNX/TensorFlow model import (planned for v0.2)
Floating-point inference (planned)
Advanced optimizations (operator fusion, etc.)

Quick Start
Prerequisites

CMake 3.15+
GCC or Clang compiler
Target-specific toolchain (for cross-compilation)

Basic Installation
bashgit clone https://github.com/[username]/cmatrix.git
cd cmatrix
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
Hello World Example
c#include "cmatrix/runtime.h"

int main() {
    // Initialize CMatrix runtime
    cmatrix_runtime_t* runtime = cmatrix_init();
    
    // Load model (compiled CMatrix format)
    cmatrix_model_t* model = cmatrix_load_model("model.cmx");
    
    // Prepare input data
    float input[784] = {/* your data */};
    float output[10];
    
    // Run inference
    cmatrix_infer(model, input, output);
    
    // Cleanup
    cmatrix_cleanup(runtime);
    return 0;
}
Architecture Overview
CMatrix uses a modular architecture where each neural network operator is implemented as a separate, pluggable component:

Model Conversion
Currently, models must be converted to CMatrix's custom format. We provide conversion scripts for:
bash# Convert from TensorFlow Lite (basic support)
python tools/convert_tflite.py model.tflite model.cmx

# Convert from ONNX (planned)
python tools/convert_onnx.py model.onnx model.cmx  # Coming soon
Supported Model Types:

Simple feedforward networks
Basic convolutional networks
Small image classification models (MobileNet-style, simplified)
