## Additional Licensing Considerations

### Third-Party Dependencies
- **Document all dependencies** and their licenses
- **Ensure compatibility** - MIT is compatible with most licenses
- **Include attribution** for any borrowed code

### Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
Consider requiring contributors to sign a simple CLA that:
- Grants you rights to their contributions
- Confirms they have the right to contribute
- Allows you to change license in future if needed

### Patent Considerations
If patent protection becomes important later, you could:
- Switch to Apache 2.0 (more complex migration)
- Add a separate patent grant
- For now, MIT is sufficient for most use cases

### Commercial Support Model
MIT license allows you to:
- Offer commercial support/consulting
- Create proprietary extensions
- Dual-license for specific customers if needed
